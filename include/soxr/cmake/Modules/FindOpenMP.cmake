# - Finds OpenMP support
# This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler.
# If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with
# openmp support are set.
#
# The following variables are set:
#   OpenMP_C_FLAGS - flags to add to the C compiler for OpenMP support
#   OPENMP_FOUND - true if openmp is detected
#
# Supported compilers can be found at http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/
#
# Modified for libsoxr not to rely on presence of C++ compiler.
