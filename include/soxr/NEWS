Version 0.1.1 (2013-03-03)
  * Minor fixes/improvements to build/tests.
  * Fix crash (e.g. with k3b) when null error pointer passed to src_create (lsr
    bindings only).
  * Fix broken resampling in many cases with SIMD and anti_aliasing_pc < 100.
  * For clarity, renamed and slightly changed usage of three parameters in
    soxr_quality_spec_t (ABI compatible, API incompatible).  An application not
    setting these parameters directly need make no change; otherwise, changes
    should be made per the following example (as shown, compatibility with both
    old/new APIs is maintained).  See also the comments on these parameters in
    soxr.h.  N.B. ABI compatibility with the 0.1.0 API may be removed in a
    future release.
      #if !defined SOXR_VERSION /* Deprecated, 0.1.0 API */
        q_spec.phase = minimum_phase? 0 : 50;
        q_spec.bw_pc = cutoff * 100;
        q_spec.anti_aliasing_pc = anti_aliasing * 100;
      #else /* 0.1.1 API */                            Explanation:
        q_spec.phase_response = minimum_phase? 0 : 50;  Renamed.
        q_spec.passband_end = cutoff;                   Renamed, no longer %.
        q_spec.stopband_begin = 2 - anti_aliasing;      Renamed, no longer %, no
      #endif                                            longer mirrored in Fs.
